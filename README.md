# Social-media-app
The app provides a platform where users can:

* Register and Login Securely: With user authentication powered by JWT tokens, users can securely register and log in. Implementing this gave me a deeper understanding of security best practices and session management.

* Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Operations: For user profiles and posts, the app provides full CRUD functionality. Using RESTful API endpoints, the backend efficiently handles operations, ensuring that user data is securely processed.

* Data Persistence with MongoDB Atlas: I connected the app to MongoDB Atlas, which introduced me to the power of cloud databases. Working with MongoDB allowed me to manage data persistence and scalability with ease, using a flexible, NoSQL schema for storing user information and posts.

# Taking it to the Cloud
* One of the most exciting aspects of the project was deploying the backend. Instead of keeping everything local, I set up an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Learning how to configure an instance and manage its deployment not only enhanced my knowledge of cloud services but also taught me how to make my application accessible to users anywhere.

# This deployment process allowed me to explore:

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): By using Amazon EC2, I gained hands-on experience with setting up virtual servers, handling SSH keys, and configuring environments for deployment.
* Seamless Database Integration: I integrated MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database solution. By connecting this to my Node.js backend, I learned how to work with a distributed, highly available database while keeping my app scalable and reliable.
# What Iâ€™ve Learned
Throughout this project, I gained extensive knowledge in:

* Frontend : React taught me how to manage state, build reusable components, and efficiently handle user input. Creating a dynamic UI that interacts with the backend in real-time was a major achievement.

* Backend Engineering: Working with Node.js and Express for the server-side operations, I implemented secure endpoints, server-side validation, and real-time data processing. Developing REST APIs helped me truly understand how frontend and backend systems communicate.

* Authentication & Security: Implementing secure authentication with JWT tokens and session management gave me an understanding of web security best practices. I can now confidently manage user authentication and protect data from SQL injections.

* Cloud Deployment: Deploying the application using AWS EC2 and managing the backend environment was a huge learning experience. Setting up a secure server, integrating with MongoDB Atlas, and ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the cloud was both challenging and rewarding.
